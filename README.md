# **Clustering Indian States based on most visited Venues**
## Introduction
There are around 29 states in India, can we find out which are the most visited states in India? and why do people visit those states? Is it because they want to do business? Just want to travel? 
Some other questions are
-Finding most visited business place?
-Finding most visited bus stations in the state.?
-In which city people visit bar most of the time?
Well there are many questions we can ask based on the location and data we have.

## Data
There were two types of data used:
1. ***Wikipedia***
   We will be using wikipedia to scrap the total number of states in India.
2. ***Foursquare API*** 
   We will be using foursquare API to get the locations of those places and most visited venues.

## Methodology
The aim is to find what are the most visited places in India, why to people go to these states.
Steps:
  1- Scrap states information from Wikipedia
  2- Get location of those states
  3- Finding Most visited places Using FourSquare API
  4- Clustering them based on their similarity


## Results
The results of this project is the cluster of states based on their similarities, we found out why do people visit particular states and what are the most visited states in India based on the user’s purpose

## Discussion
If we could get the most visited places in States in India based on their venues, so next time if we are visiting that states we will know that this perticular state is know for this kind of purpose Eg. Kerala	is know for "Indian Restaurant Food" so if we plan to visit Kerala we atleast visit some Indian Restaurant and experince some good food.
## Conclusion
In the project we clustered the states based on their similarities, as we saw that, most visited venus are Business Service, Hotel and Restaurant. These are some of the major states of India. 
Surprisingly Bus Stations are most visited Places in Maharashtra and ‘Bar’ is most visited venue in Daman and Diu (This is perfectly accurate :P )
